### Minimal Gatsby Typescript Starter (with some opinions)

This is my minimal starter for Gatsby+Typescript web apps. I use this combo a lot so I boiled down the essentials into one package.
[t3.gg](https://t3.gg), my personal site, is powered with this template.

I'm too lazy to detail/justify my opinions now so just `yarn install` and `gatsby develop` away
